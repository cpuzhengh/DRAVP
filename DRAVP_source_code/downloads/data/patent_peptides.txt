The coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed within this specification mimic all or a portion of the internal, trimeric coiled-coil motif contained within the fusogenic conformation of an enveloped virus membrane-fusion protein, particularly the internal coiled-coil domain of the HIV gp41 ectodomain. The HIV-derived, chimeric peptides disclosed comprise a non-HIV, soluble, trimeric form of a coiled-coil fused in helical phase to all or a portion of the N-helix of HIV gp41 and are covalently-stabilized in a homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structure through the formation of disulfide or chemoselective bonds between said peptides. The covalently-stabilized, HIV-derived, homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed herein represent a close mimetic of a HIV gp41 fusion intermediate and are potent inhibitors of HIV infectivity. These HIV-derived chimeric peptides may provide for therapeutic treatment against HIV infection by inhibiting the virus-host cell membrane fusion process."		Anti-HIV

The covalently-stabilized, HIV-derived, homotrimeric or heterotrimeric coiled-coil structures made by the methods disclosed herein represent a close mimetic of a HIV gp41 fusion intermediate and are potent inhibitors of HIV infectivity. These HIV-derived chimeric peptides may provide for therapeutic treatment against HIV infection by inhibiting the virus-host cell membrane fusion process."		Anti-HIV

"The present invention discloses a method of treating an ophthalmic infection by administering to a vertebrate inflicted with the ophthalmic infection an ophthalmologically effective amount of an antimicrobial peptide which is derived from alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) and biologically functional equivalents thereof. Specifically, the antimicrobial peptides derived from alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (-MSH) include -MSH (1C13) which is SYSMEHFRWGKPV, -MSH (4C10) which is MEHFRWG, -MSH (6C13) which is HFRWGKPV, -MSH (11C13) which is KPV, and a KPV dimer. The ophthalmic infection can be caused by a microorganism which include a bacteria, a fungi or a virus. The vertebrate includes a bird and a mammal. The antimicrobial peptide has anti-bacterial, antifungal, and antiviral property and therefore can be administered at the onset of the ophthalmic infection before the microorganism causing the infection is determined as well as thereafter."
